# Guidelines to proposal writing

Blockchain relies on open source collaboration to drive technical development. This practice is seen most clearly in the Ethereum proposal process which we covered in Lecture 1 but also extends to use cases such as voting on important decisions of a protocol, fundraising, creating awareness, etc. An interesting example of this would be when MakerDAO was hacked, the community took a vote of whether they should compensate the victims of the hack fully, partially or not at all. Spoiler alert, the decision was to compensate nothing.

For the proposal format of this course, we will *loosely* follow the format of an EIP. If you would like more details on the motivations behind Ethereum's proposal structure, see [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1). Please section your proposal as below.

**Snapshot hint** - Snapshot is able to parse markdown!

### Title
The title should be a call to action. What do you want your voters to do? It should also provide enough context for voters to have an idea of the content just from reading the title. It is your main idea and action call summed up into one sentence.

### Metadata
Metadata is used to categorize proposals. You can see them as tags which enable easy searching. This is necessary when there are thousands of proposals but for the course, the only Metadata that needs to be provided are **Author** and **Date Created**.

### Abstract
One paragraph summary of the most important points that you are presenting. It is an elevator pitch, a summary of your work. It is enough to write 2 or 3 points.

### Motivation
Why is your topic important? Why should people think about this topic?

This section outlines the benefits and impact of the topic that is presented. For example, if the topic is on quadratic voting, the main motivation is to allow representation of minority voters in a DAO.

### Detailed Specification
This section displays in detail research or information supporting the proposal. This is usually the longest section in a proposal. For technical proposals, in detail code is given. For financial or social proposals, budgets, models, roadmaps are presented.

Additionally, upload your presentation to the [class repository](https://github.com/Dauphine-Digital-Economics/presentations) and add in the link.
