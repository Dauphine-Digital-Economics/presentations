# Guidelines to proposal writing

Blockchain relies on open source collaboration to drive technical development. This practice is seen most clearly in the Ethereum proposal process which we covered in Lecture 1 but also extends to use cases such as voting on important decisions of a protocol, fundraising, creating awareness, etc.

For the proposal format of this course, we will *loosely* follow the format of an EIP. If you would like more details on the motivations behind Ethereum's proposal structure, see [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1). Please section your proposal as below.

**Formatting hint:** - Snapshot is able to parse markdown!

### Title
The title should be a call to action. What do you want your voters to do? It should also provide enough context for voters to have an idea of the content just from reading the title. It is your main idea and action call summed up into one sentence.

### Metadata
Metadata is used to categorize proposals. You can see them as tags which enable easy searching. This is necessary when there are thousands of proposals but for the course, the only Metadata that needs to be provided are **Author** and **Date Created**.

### Abstract
One paragraph summary of the most important points that you are presenting. It is an elevator pitch, a summary of your work. It is enough to write 2 or 3 points.

### Motivation
Why is your topic important? Why should people think about this topic?

Outline the problem or past pain point that the topic address and the benefits and impact of the topic - either technical or financial.

### Detailed Specification
This section provides a summary of the most important points of the presentation as well as any supporting research or information.

Additionally, provide a link of your presentation so readers can refer back to it. In this case, the link should be what you uploaded into the presentation repository.
