### Content quality

### Oral delivery
1. Presented clearly and at a good speaking pace
1. Relatively smooth transitions - between team members, code demonstrations, etc.
1. Using the slides as help and not directly reading off slides

### Written proposal on Snapshot
1. Was the description of the proposal following the proposal format as listed on Homework 1?

1. Readability - the description is clear and motivating. Provides all the information but does not ramble on and puts voters off.
