# presentations

A repository for weekly and final presentations.

### Weekly presentations

15min long with 3min of questions covering topics which were not presented in lectures in order to reflect the student's research capabilities. The presentation is graded by the professor as well as voted on in the [Class DAO](https://demo.snapshot.org/#/dauphine.eth). The aim is to practice proposal writing and voting in addition to traditional presentation methods.

### Final presentations

20 - 25min long with 5min of questions.
